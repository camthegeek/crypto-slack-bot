Open index.js, edit the variables at the top

## PLEASE NOTE
This is a personal project. This is not something I plan to update on a regular basis. It has been fun to write and is actively used within a certain Monero Mining Slack group that I associate with.

Some of the code in this unused. Other parts are faulty. This is a work in progress. I can not gaurentee this will work on your system.
